Introduction

This course has a 30%-weighted coursework component which will require you to use Tableau to create a story (a collection of dashboards) to discover commercial insights from a provided dataset. The purpose of the project is for you to demonstrate your ability to create effective data visualisations using Tableau to communicate key insights to senior management.

Deliverable content

Your task will be to explore the dataset using Tableau's data visualisation tools in an effort to extract commercially-important insights in preparation for a presentation of your findings to senior management of the company.

The deliverable content will be in two parts:

A story (a collection of five dashboards) created in Tableau

An accompanying 1,500-word report, which describes the key insights from the story, including recommendations to senior management as a result of your discoveries
Which visualisations and which variables you wish to explore will be depend on your judgement. The task is designed to simulate real-life situations when business analysts are faced with raw data and need to spend time exploring, or mining, the dataset hoping to discover interesting trends, patterns, and relationships.

How clear your dashboards are, ie, how effective your chosen visualisations are at showing the insights

Creativity and imagination in your choice of visualisations

The quality and professionalism of the story

How well the accompanying report relates to the Tableau story, i.e. the reader of the report and story should be clear on the findings in the same way as if the reader had attended a verbal presentation of the story. 

The relevance of the recommendations to senior management contained within the report.

The quality and professionalism of the story and report.
